This is the IRremote library for the PIC18F2550 (e.g. used on USB Infrared Toy from dangerousprototypes.com).

It is an port by Marco Koehler of the IRremote library for the Arduino from Ken Shirriff. 

To download from github (http://github.com/stino/Pic-IRremote), click on the "Downloads" link in the upper right, click "Download as zip", and get a zip file.

To install, move the downloaded IRremote directory to:
your project folder and the files to your project inside mplab.

At the moment only XC8 compiler is supported but it should be possible to support C18 compiler as well.

After installation you should have files such as:
/IRremote/IRremote.c
